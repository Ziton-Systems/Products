# Product Service Agreement & Terms of Service

Our company follows a strict ToS (Terms of Service) policy to ensure that our assets and work is respected and not infringed upon. These policies have been hand-picked and assessed, so our policy stays transparent, reasonable and fair. If you chose to not follow our ToS we will take action against you or your group with the escalation guidelines written below. If you have any suggestions about improvements or changes to the policy, please do not hesitate to contact us on the appropriate management support lines. 
A four-step escalation guide is followed, first you will receive notification of your breach of guidelines if an appropriate way to do so is found. If staff cannot contact you, we may implement a short-term ban on your use of our assets with an in-game notification, but if no one can contact you we will automatically advance to the next step. If you have ignored all contact attempts then a two-week blacklist and two strikes on the communication server will be issued. Once the two weeks is up you will have to get into contact with a member of the Board of Directors to appeal you blacklist. If appealing is unsuccessful or another offence is committed than a permanent blacklist will be given and you will be forever disallowed to use our products or join our communication server.

**1.1 - Product Model Modification**

In regards to product modification we allow basic model modification. We allow consumers to change logo positions or product scaling as long as all logos and visible and the model is still recognisable. If logos are removed completely or are made to be intentionally hard to view or product models have been drastically remodelled without prior approval from a member of development or directors’ team then a case will be opened and you receive the appropriate consequences.

**1.2 - Product Script Modification**

We completely do not allow any form of script modification or reverse engineering as this can put users at risk of damaging their games or being blacklisted. Only modifications such as given variables or set configuration values are permitted to be edited. Any attempt to reverse engineer or attack on our product modules and public hosted scripts will lead to an immediate blacklist from all companies and close affiliates.

**2.1 - Product Licenses**

 Our products use three main types of licensing (Purchase, Player, Game) any any attempts to pirate, bypass or reverse engineer our license system is a bannable offence and if found will result in a permanent ban. We strongly believe that pirating from small developers is unacceptable as you should value the hard work that is put into these products. 

**2.2 - Unauthorised Asset Use**

We completely do not allow our assets to be used for other systems, especially those made by other development groups. Also, we do not allow your to use unlicensed assets or stolen goods to be used within our products. For example, if you have an unlicensed model for an accessory you want to add to our products we do not allow it. Please remember if the asset is licenced or custom made we do allow you to use it as an accessory as long as the company that owns that asset approves and it does not breach any other parts of our ToS. 

**3.1.1 – Free model distribution**

If you wish to share our free products with above 5 people then you must attain the appropriate permission by opening a support ticket and getting it escalated to an appropriate member of the management team. You will require a valid reason to why you want to distribute our products and this may be denied with little or no reasoning. 

**3.1.2 – Paid/demo model distribution**

Any form of sharing of demo units or paid models without prior permission from a member of the development team is unauthorised. Often demo units will only be shared with internal staff and people who are enrolled in the BTP (Beta Testing Program) or the Developers Scheme and within those programs you will not have permission to share the model with anyone. If your entire company is registered in the Developers Scheme then you will be able to internally share the model for purposes and development and bug reporting. If you are found to have shared paid assets we will also launch an internal investigation to check if you have tampered with the model and if, so you may also receive punishment on the grounds of product licensing bypasses or unauthorised product modifications.

**3.3 – Product Commissions**

If you order a commission, you have no permission to distribute it or properly access it until you have paid in full. Once you have paid and it all has been process and logged you will then have full permission to do whatever you would like with it. If logos are present or code signatures are inside scripts you may remove them. We would prefer for you not to sell on the commission, but we are unlikely to take action. If you order a commission based upon a already existing product you may be subject to certain terms and encryption within the code, but this is delt with on a case by case basis. 

**3.4 – Profit Regulations**

We do not allow you to profit from our products in any way. You may not offer paid installs or provide our assets in your paid games and map templates. 

## **These terms are subject to change and are not final, we will publicly announce if we change and of these policies.**
